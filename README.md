# Password Generator

The purpose of this webpage is to create a randomly generated password based on the user's requirements. When the user clicks the "generate password" button, he/she must first input their desired length: a value between 8 and 128. The screenshot below shows where the user will input this information.

# Length Criteria


### Non-Numeric Character

If the user selects an invalid, non-numeric character, the screen will display the message below and the user will have the opportunity to enter a valid value: 

<img src = "pics/enterA.png" width = 600px >

### Numeric value not within 8-128

If the user enters a value less than 8 or greater than 128, the screen will display the message below and the user will have the opportunity to re-enter a valid value:

# Character Selection: Special, Upper Case, Lower Case, Numeric

Once the user has selected a valid character length, he/she will then be prompted with the option to include:

### Special Characters

### Upper Case Characters
<img src = "pics/upperCase.png" width = 600px >

### Lower Case Characters 
<img src = "pics/lowerCase.png" width = 600px >

### Numeric Characters 
<img src = "pics/numeric.png" width = 600px >

If the user does not select any character choice (special, upper, lower, numeric) then he/she will be prompted with a message that instructs the user to select at least one character type: 
<img src = "pics/NoCriteriaSelected.png" width = 600px >

When a user has selected a valid password length with at least one character type, the password will be generated and displayed for the user as seen below:
